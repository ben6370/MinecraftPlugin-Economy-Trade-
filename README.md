# How to use this Minecraft Plugin [Economy&Trade]
Self-made plug-in system that includes trading and economic systems.
Plugin supports the 1.21 server and does not support single-player use.
<p>This is the first version of the plug-in, with more functions, such as PVP, mini-games, backpack expansion, etc. 
</p><p>The future goal will be to focus on an all-in-one plugin package. Players can enjoy multiple effects as long as they download one plug-in.</p>

<h2>Economic System</h2>
<p>Enter <code>/money</code> to check your balance. The balance can be used to make transactions in the store.</p>

<h2>Trading System</h2>
<p>When you enter the server where this plugin is installed, a branch named "Trading" will appear in your backpack. <code>Right-click</code>  to open the store function, where you can buy or sell your own goods. This saves players from spending extra time building their own exchanges.</p>

<h2>Logging System</h2>
<p>Basic server welcome prompts and introduction to related functions</p>
