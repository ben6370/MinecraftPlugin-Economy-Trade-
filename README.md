# Minecraft Plugin [Economy&Trade]
Self-made plug-in system that includes trading and economic systems.
<p>This is the first version of this plugin, with more functions such as PVP, mini-games, backpack expansion, etc.</p>

<h2>Economic System</h2>
<p>Enter <code>/money</code> to check your balance. The balance can be used to make transactions in the store.</p>

<h2>Trading System</h2>
<p>When you enter the server where this plugin is installed, a branch named "Trading" will appear in your backpack. Right-click to open the store function, where you can buy or sell your own goods. This saves players from spending extra time building their own exchanges.</p>
